                <p>I was ice and he was fire,<br>He was all that I desired.<br>He was the rainbow when I was rain,<br>He was the analgesic to all my pain.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    He could dig me to shallows,<br>He could soar me to the sky.<br>He would be my wallow,<br>Or the reason why I cry.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Sometimes, with the warmth of sunshine,<br>But at times, burning like scorched heat.<br>He was my addiction just like wine,<br>He was what no one could beat.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    He was the core of my evolution,<br>He was my perspicuous vision.<br>He was my  guided supposition,<br>He was my only unassailable intuition.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    He could expose all my scars,<br>And he could heal all my sore.<br>Forever may I be his prisoner in bars,<br>But I will always need him more.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    He is all the sins I commit,<br>And he's my only virtue.<br>In my life,his chaos I won't ever remit,<br>If I am unconditionally true.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Let me drown in his ocean,<br>Or die starving in his desert.<br>I will love him incessantly is my notion,<br>That is all that I can assert.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    He was mine and I was his,<br>Whatever may be the situation.<br>All I needed ever was just this,<br>He was my chaotic perfection.<br>

                <p>There was dark, but then I found light,<br>Everything was wrong, you made it right.<br>The dull in me was painted in a thousand hue,<br>That's what happened when I found you.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I was lost, you became my only known way,<br>In the gloom, you were my ray.<br>I found my true version completely new,<br>That's what happened when I found you.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I happened to smile,<br>Forget my agonies for a little while.<br>My heart feels myself if I'm being true,<br>That's what happened when I found you.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I got scared of my memories,<br>Which brought back the worries.<br>Calm and peace replaced the inner ado,<br>That's what happened when I found you.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I was in pain but i healed because of you,<br>I was at my worst but I am at my best because of you.<br>I suppress my emotions but express them in front of you,<br>I hated my fate but thank it now because I found you.<br>It was hell and I found heaven with you,<br>That's what happened when I found you.<br>

                <p>Tapping to the sounds of tunes around me,<br>People having good times was all I could see.<br>Then apparently the music paused-and an awkward silence prevailed,<br>There was nothing common to talk about and so the fake fun bailed.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    And the fainting music the rain gave,<br>Made me want to be a little naive.<br>Why can't I take pride in doing wrong?<br>Why can't I stay silent and not sing along?<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Why can't people around me know that I'm miserable and weak?<br>Why do they presume charm on my smile when it's actually bleak?<br>Shall I always appear strong when all I can feel is a void?<br>How long can I hold when my inner self is completely destroyed?<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Why can't these people know what I really feel?<br>Why do they judge instead of helping me to heal?<br>Why does discussing my failures become a talk show?<br>Wish people could know what I wanted them to know.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    And so, the music played again,<br>These thoughts drowned which they may never recall,<br>And this realisation faded just like the music of the rain,<br>Maybe this world enjoys fake shows after all.<br>

                <p>I remember the night when you and me became we,<br>But it was the fate which I didn't foresee.<br>I remember that moment which flushed my soul,<br>Now it pierces my heart like a deep hole.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I remember the night you made me mine,<br>Each element around us, a beautiful chime.<br>I remember each time you looked and smiled,<br>Which now feels like a jinx realizing how exquisitely you lied.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Then came the night you said it,<br>The night you decided to end it.<br>I remember the tears that rolled down,<br>And remember your face with no frown.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I remember your heart that went cold,<br>The one which was once enfolded in gold.<br>I remember the way you looked away,<br>Breaking the promise that you'll always stay.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I remember the sigh of relief you took,<br>And all the good memories you refused to look.<br>I remember how I pleaded you to stay,<br>Denying that there can actually be a way.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Each hurting memory made it hard to elope,<br>Drowning me in a gloom with no ray of hope.<br>You made me face the hardest times and the worst,<br>The boon of my life which felt cursed.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Now all I remember is,<br>That I made myself strong,<br>It wasn't me who was wrong.<br>All that happened was a celestial spell,<br>I can now have the love that I give myself.<br>Grateful to you for letting me realize my worth,<br>Letting me have what I truly deserve.<br>

                <h1>The Phases Of Life</h1>
                <p>Looking at the rain,<br>Bearing all the pain,<br>Raindrops falling like my tears,<br>I was confronting my tears.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Recalling that sunrise,<br>The clear aesthetic skies,<br>Who knew the clouds would take it all,<br>Who knew this would be the way I'll fall.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I try, I try and I try again,<br>Who knew life would be such a constraint,<br>I ignored darkness over the bright moon,<br>Oblivion of my impending doom.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    I'm falling apart like the autumn leaves,<br>Difficulties like the hustling winds,<br>I doubt that I'll ever find peace,<br>Waiting to see if spring ever begins.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    A snow Angel living it all,<br>As I witness the falling snow,<br>This is a faint memory I now recall,<br>As I'm frozen in the devilry of life I didn't know.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    Bt the morning is a pursuit of the gloomy night,<br>Maybe this darkness will be invaded by light,<br>Maybe my life is like this unpredictable weather,<br>Maybe I just need hope, faith and belief altogether.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    The darkness and light all have their roles,<br>Devote it all to what you desire,<br>Fall down, get up, every time just soar higher,<br>It is life, it has phases, it is its beauty you need to admire.<br>
                    <br><br>
                    THANK YOU!<br><br><br><br><br>
